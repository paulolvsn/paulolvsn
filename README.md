## Hello ðŸ‘‹

**28** year old **Brussels-based Brazilian** junior web developer, I've recently discovered the world of programming and have found my passion.

You can find here some of the projects I've worked on, both in group and solo. I have a soft spot for **frontend**, but very interested in **backend** too.

Since I was a child, my dream was to be able to speak to the entire human population, which is why I learned some languages. Little did I know that my passion would extend to wanting to be able to talk with  machines too. ðŸ¤”

I'm currently looking for a **2(or 3)-month internship** to consolidate what I've learned at **BeCode** (and of course, learn much more by doing).

Don't hesitate to contact me via [email](**paulolvsn@gmail.com**) or on my [Linkedin account](http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulolvsn).
